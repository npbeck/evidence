# Description
This repository belongs to the **research project 'Evidence'** by TU Darmstadt's Ubiquitious Knowledge Processing Lab.

The project aims to provide lexicographers with an interactive machine-learning-powered interface, easing and speeding up the process of choosing good example sentences, given a lemma.

# Content
This repository consists of two main components:
1. `flask_web_app/` - a web application designed to be used by lexicographers
2. `experiments/` - a couple of python libraries and scripts designed to be used for generating data representations (embeddings)
and then training machine-learning models with those representations

# Exemplary use case
Say you had a CSV file with annotated sentence examples in the following format:
`<example sentence>, <lemma>, <score>`. 
(We actually do not even require a `<lemma>` field, since we assume the lemma to be marked
in the example sentence using tags, e.g. `"This sentence's lemma is _&cow&_."`)

You could then load this CSV file and generate embeddings, i.e. fixed-size representations of the sentence and its lemma
using the `experiments/embeddings.py` library as well as the `experiments/embeddings_script.py` file.

Having generated the respective embeddings you could then move on to training a model with them. `experiments/log_reg.py` 
and its respective script provide you with a way of training a logistic regression, while `experiments/mlp.py` and its respective
script allow you to train a simple multilayer perceptron.

# Further remarks
This repository is a copy of the original repository which at this point (Aug 25, 2020) remains private and in development. Sensitive data such as the training data sets and pretrained models was removed prior to this repository being uploaded.
